Graphical User Interface
=============================

- The QGIS Graphic User Interface (GUI) allows the user to select the module/analysis to perform, the inputs, and the customized style files to display (see Appendix A).
- Upon installation of the SEAT package, an icon will appear in the plugin toolbar.

Stressor
--------

- To choose the analysis/data type in the "Select Stressor" Dropdown box.
- Currently 3 options exist

- **Shear Stress Module** – analysis of spatial change in bed mobility
- **Velocity Module**	- analysis of spatial change in larval motility
- **ParAcousti Module** – analysis of acoustic propagation and thresholds

Coordinate Reference System
----------------------------

- The correct display and analysis of the data requires knowledge of the data’s coordinate reference system, sometimes not present in the data structure.

Model Results Directory
-----------------------

- There are two model result directories needed for the analysis, the baseline results directory and the model results director.

.. - Select the directory containing the model results with devices and the directory containing the baseline (without devices) model results. These model results must be in netCDF format.

- The model results can have 2 formats.
  
  1. A concatenated single \*.nc file with the model run number as the first dimension [RunNo, Depth, X, Y]. (Only one file per directory if this format is used).
  2. Multiple files with naming format name_RunNum_map.nc, where RunNum must come before the map.nc and be separated by a single underscore on either side.

- The number of baseline model files must match the device model files.
