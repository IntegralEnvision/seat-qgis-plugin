Spatial Environmental Assessment Toolkit
===================================================

Spatial Environmental Assessment Toolkit (SEAT) is a python QGIS plugin which generates spatial assessment maps and statistical csv files. SEAT allows users to create risk quantification maps using by providing a framework for combining numerical model results with site-specific information allowing provider users a tools to optimize array layouts and limit negative environmental effects.


Modules
-------

The behavior of the plugin depends on the input and is subdivided into 4 modules:
  
  1. **Shear Stress Module** - analysis of spatial change in bed mobility
  2. **Velocity Module** - analysis of spatial change in larval motility
  3. **Acoustics Module** - analysis of acoustic propagation and thresholds
  4. **Power Module** - analysis of power generated by WEC/CEC array
