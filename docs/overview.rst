Introduction
------------

Development of Marine Energy (ME) in the United States is a growing a dynamic energy sector. Energy resources generated by ocean waves and currents due to ocean tides and river discharge have the potential to support regional power grids and divestment from fossil fuel use for power generation in remote areas. As the industry becomes more robust and studies expand from testing single devices to deploying arrays to harness greater amounts of energy, the effect of MRE activities will grow. Good ocean stewardship and permitting/licensing requires ME developers to consider how their device, or more importantly a commercial sized array of devices, could change environmental conditions. 
Ongoing efforts to quantify and compare levels of change to the environment have led to the development of individual numerical models that represent the dynamics of these devices within the environment. Numerical models such as SNL-Delft3D-CEC-FM and SNL-SWAN take into account the presence of ME devices on tidal and river currents and ocean waves, respectively. 
Sandia’s Spatial Environmental Assessment Toolkit (SEAT) connects these physics-based simulation tools with site-specific information to quantitatively describe MRE-driven changes to the physical and acoustic environment. The SEAT allows ME project developers to focus on navigating site- and technology-specific challenges via simulation tools that can assess, a priori, the anticipated impact a ME project may have on the environment while also considering optimal array designs. As such, the SEAT is designed to be agnostic with respect to the type of marine energy development being considered and can assess a wide variety of marine energy devices using international standard description and assessment practices. 

SEAT Components
---------------

- The SEAT is a python backend QGIS plugin which generates spatial assessment maps and statistical csv files.
- The behavior of the plugin depends on the input and is subdivided into 4 modules:
  
  * Shear Stress Module – analysis of spatial change in shear stress and effects on bed mobility
  * Velocity Module - analysis of spatial change flow velocity and effects on species/larval motility. 
  * Acoustics Module – analysis of acoustic propagation and threshold exceedance to marine species
  * Power Module – analysis of power generated by WEC/CEC array
